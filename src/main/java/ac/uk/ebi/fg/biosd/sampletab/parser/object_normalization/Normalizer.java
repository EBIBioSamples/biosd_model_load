/**
 * Object normalisers are meant to take an instance of the BioSD object model and merge those objects that have to be
 * reused. This can be done in-memory, typically after having parsed a SampleTab submission, where duplicates created by
 * the underlining Limpopo-based parser are unified, or it can be done just before saving a {@link MSI a SampleTab Submission}
 * into a relational database, where objects that already exist in the DB replace the ones in memory (created from scratch).
 * 
 * The two type of normalisation are achieved using the same normaliser components (i.e., the subclasses of this class)
 * by simply using two different {@link Store} implementations, {@link MemoryStore one} that keeps/lookup objects in a 
 * {@link Table double-key hash table} and the {@link DBStore other one}Â that lookup existing objects into a relational database.
