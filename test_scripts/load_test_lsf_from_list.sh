Tests the loading of all files listed in the standard input. You need to first issue 'mvn -P<proper-profile> test-compile'  
with a profile corresponding to your database target. Loading Results are reported in a summary file.
  
This command is affected by the environment variable SAMPLING_RATIO, if it is less than 100, only a random subset of the 
submissions in the target directory is loaded.
